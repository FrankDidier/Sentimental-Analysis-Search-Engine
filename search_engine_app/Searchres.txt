Click to subscribe! On a trip to a Ford plant late last week, Trump said that he wore a mask away from reporters and cameras but took it off because he "didn't want to give the press the pleasure of seeing it." (Someone did snap a photo of Trump with a mask on .) On Sunday, Axios' Jonathan Swan reported this : "Trump, meanwhile, is out and about -- masks be damned .. Watch for plenty more mask-free outings from Trump, hyping the reopening of the economy and avoiding discussions of social distancing and death counts." Then on Memorial Day, the President retweeted this from Brit Hum e in which the Fox News personality appears to mock former Vice President Joe Biden for his appearance while wearing a black mask during a wreath-laying ceremony Read More This might help explain why Trump doesn't like to wear a mask in public Biden today pic.twitter.com/9l1gw1ljBE — Brit Hume (@brithume) May 25, 2020 What's so remarkable about all of this is that there is no real debate about mask-wearing and its impact on mitigating the spread of the virus "Medical masks, like the N95, offer the most protection, but experts widely agree that several types of facial coverings, including ones made of fabric, are effective at slowing virus spread," wrote PolitiFact recently Speaking of "experts," here's what Dr Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus task force coordinator, said about masks during an appearance on "Fox News Sunday": "What we have said to people is there is clear scientific evidence now, by all the droplet experiments that happened, and that others have done, to show that a mask does prevent droplets from reaching others Out of respect for each other, as Americans that care for each other, we need to be wearing masks in public when we cannot social distance." Given that, you would think that the President of the United States -- seeking to set an example of the proper behavior in the midst of a global pandemic -- might deign to don a mask Because public health isn't a partisan issue, a fact Republican governors from North Dakota to Ohio have advocated for in recent days What Trump either doesn't understand or doesn't care about is that the way leaders act has a profound impact on how the general public acts People take their cues from the most high profile among us -- including and especially the president Don't believe me? Witness this exchange on an Alabama beach over Memorial Day weekend between a beach-goer and CNN's Gary Tuchman : MAN: I mean, if he's not wearing a mask, I'm not going to wear a mask If he's not worried, I'm not worried TUCHMAN: The President? MAN: Yes, sir JUST WATCHED CNN reporter debunks beachgoers' coronavirus theories Replay More Videos .. MUST WATCH CNN reporter debunks beachgoers' coronavirus theories 03:19 So, yeah When you have the President of the United States sending a clear signal that a) he doesn't need to wear a mask and b) wearing a mask makes you look weak, then no one should be surprised that people -- like that kid in Alabama -- follow Trump's lead Trump has repeatedly demonstrated during his time in the White House that he lacks any understanding of the moral leadership that the office of the President has long conveyed in the country That his words and his actions have profound consequences That it's not just about him and what he thinks is best for him Trump's politicizing of mask-wearing is in keeping with this long-held moral vacuum in the Trump White House But unlike some of the President's past absences of moral leadership, this one could cost people their lives Search US Crime + Justice Energy + Environment Extreme Weather Space + Science World Africa Americas Asia Australia China Europe India Middle East United Kingdom Politics Donald Trump Supreme Court Congress Facts First 2020 Election Business Markets Tech Media Success Perspectives Videos Opinion Political Op-Eds Social Commentary Health Food Fitness Wellness Parenting Vital Signs Entertainment Stars Screen Binge Culture Media Tech Innovate Gadget Foreseeable Future Mission: Ahead Upstarts Work Transformed Innovative Cities Style Arts Design Fashion Architecture Luxury Beauty Video Travel Destinations Food and Drink Stay News Videos Sports Pro Football College Football Basketball Baseball Soccer Olympics Videos Live TV Digital Studios CNN Films HLN TV Schedule TV Shows A-Z CNNVR Coupons CNN Underscored Explore Wellness Gadgets Lifestyle CNN Store More Photos Longform Investigations CNN Profiles CNN Leadership CNN Newsletters Work for CNN Weather Climate Storm Tracker Video Follow CNN Politics Terms of Use Privacy Policy Accessibility & CC AdChoices About Us CNN Studio Tours CNN Store Newsletters Transcripts License Footage CNN Newsource Sitemap © 2020 Cable News Network Turner Broadcasting System, Inc All Rights Reserved CNN Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network

President Trump’s struggles to stand still during a Memorial Day visit to Arlington National Cemetery lit up social media Monday, prompting users to recall past incidents in which the commander in chief, who turns 74 next month, battled to find a balance Advertisement “Is the President having trouble standing up straight as the National Anthem begins at Arlington Cemetary (sic) or am I seeing things?” Joshua Potash from Queens asked on Twitter The Trump critic posted that video , along with another clearly showing the president swaying in front of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier Advertisement Potash wasn’t alone in finding the somber moment moving in a different way “I think it’s the bone spurs,” joked tweeter Kimberley Cooke, referring to one of the five draft deferments that got the president out of serving in the military during the Vietnam War Some critics wondered about the president’s physical and mental well-being after seeing the bizarre video Others suggested he may be wearing uncomfortable shoes It was also pointed out that the president could be tired from the weekend he spent on the golf course after several months away from the links on account of the coronavirus pandemic Trump rips ex-POW John McCain’s war record — ‘I like people who weren’t captured’ — and GOP candidates fire back » Trump started Memorial Day by rage-tweeting that the press was out of line for covering his decision to golf when nationwide deaths tied to the COVID-19 pandemic neared the 100,000 mark “What they don’t say is that it was my first golf in almost 3 months,” he wrote on Twitter The President frequently uses a golf cart rather than walking the course The fact that Trump recently said he’d been taking the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine also arose in the Twittersphere, though the president reportedly said Sunday he was no longer using that medication Weather.com indicates winds were coming in around 4 mph Monday Most Read Trump’s struggles to stand still didn’t go unnoticed during Memorial Day visit to Arlington Cuomo says New York is ready to ‘supercharge’ reopening, will talk infrastructure with Trump 'It was unacceptable’: White woman who called cops on black man in Central Park after he asked her to leash her dog apologizes The president got straight to the point Monday by standing up for military personnel fighting the war against coronavirus “Tens of thousands of service members and national guardsmen are on the front lines of our war against this terrible virus,” Trump said “As one nation, we mourn alongside every single family that has lost loved ones, including the families of our great Veterans.” The president’s poor posture was the focus of a “Daily Show” segment in November that featured several images of Trump in strange stances Advertisement “There’s one Donald Trump quirk that has not gotten the attention it deserves and that has to be the way he stands,” host Trevor Noah joked “That is not how a normal human being stands.” In 2016, Vanity Fair also made the president’s posture an issue with a photo-driven story that asks, “Why can’t Trump stand up straight?"

These people declined to be named as these fundraising efforts are being made in private Kudlow told CNBC earlier this year that he believed the U.S had the virus contained , only to walk back those comments a month later He has been a vocal opponent of China during the pandemic and recently said that the administration is looking at providing cash incentives to encourage unemployed Americans to go back to work.  More than 30 million people have filed for unemployment Most of these private events have been tailored for the Trump Victory committee, a joint fundraising operation that distributes donations to the president's campaign and the RNC The events are not necessarily focused on bringing in six figure checks Many organizers have asked for donors to contribute up to $35,000 and events were expected to bring in at least $250,000, one of the people said That represents a change from what was taking place prior to states shutting down earlier this year, when the Trump campaign and RNC were hosting events that would, at times, charge up to $580,600 per couple All campaigns have gone fully virtual since March when states started shutting down due to the spread of the pandemic Trump's campaign and the RNC combined to raise just over $61 million in the month of April, while their rivals, Joe Biden and the Democratic National Committee, took in $60.5 million over that same time period While Trump and the RNC have more cash on hand than their Democratic opponents, having White House advisors taking part in their virtual events comes as many donors across the political spectrum have prioritized other matters over giving to campaigns Trump administration officials can skirt by potential violations of the Hatch Act if they are not officially using their titles or government resources to raise money for the campaign In this case, Kudlow, Perdue and others are not in violation of the law, which prohibits government employees from directly soliciting campaign cash from donors "The Hatch Act would prohibit the use of official titles or resources in connection with a fundraising event but if a cabinet official is just described as a 'special guest' or 'the honorable' it is okay," Brendan Fischer, a director at the watchdog Campaign Legal Center, told CNBC An RNC official confirmed in a statement that White House advisors are involved with fundraising events but only as "special guests." "Any White House official who takes part in a Trump Victory event with supporters does so in their personal capacity in accordance with the law They are special guests and do not solicit funds," this committee official explained A spokesman for the White House declined to comment A representative for the Department of Agriculture referred questions about Perdue being a virtual fundraising guest to the campaign Kudlow did not return multiple emails seeking comment The fact that White House advisors are taking the time to get on fundraising calls is likely to come under scrutiny by Democrats who have been critical of the president and his team's efforts in combating the coronavirus A Real Clear Politics national polling average shows Biden ahead of Trump by close to six points Trump came under fire this weekend by Biden's campaign for golfing in Virginia as the U.S coronavirus death toll rose toward 100,000 The president has signed close to $2.5 trillion worth of stimulus legislation Yet he is criticized by Democrats for, as they claim, not distributing enough personal protective equipment to states Trump has also been hit for appearing to downplay the potential harmful effects of hydroxychloriquine, which he said he used to ward off the virus Studies have shown that the anti-malaria drug could lead to higher mortality rates in coronavirus patients Trump recently said he had been taking the drug but stopped The Food and Drug Administration have previously warned against taking malaria drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to treat Covid-19 outside a hospital or formal clinical trial setting VIDEO 6:01 06:01 Larry Kudlow: China will be held accountable for coronavirus Squawk on the Street Related Tags Larry Kudlow Sonny Perdue Joe Biden Donald Trump Elections Subscribe to CNBC PRO Licensing & Reprints CNBC Councils Supply Chain Values Advertise With Us Join the CNBC Panel Digital Products News Releases Closed Captioning Corrections About CNBC Internships Site Map Podcasts AdChoices Careers Help Contact News Tips Got a confidential news tip?
